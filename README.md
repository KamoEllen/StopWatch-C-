# StopWatch-C-

This code uses the time() and difftime() functions from the C++ standard library to measure the elapsed time between starting and stopping the stopwatch. The elapsed time is printed in milliseconds.

You can modify and expand upon this code to add more functionality to your stopwatch program, such as the ability to display the elapsed time in other units like seconds or minutes, or to provide more detailed information about the elapsed time.
